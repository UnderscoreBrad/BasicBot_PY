BasicBot is an open-source, Python-based Discord bot with basic functionality including youtube playback and Teamspeak-style VC join/leave messages, and keyword-based censoring! More features are planned (Role management, youtube queue). The source code can be found at https://github.com/UnderscoreBrad/BasicBot_PY and the bot is hosted locally for now.
