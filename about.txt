BasicBot is an open-source, Python-based Discord bot with basic functionality including youtube playback (with queue support) and Teamspeak-style VC join/leave messages, and keyword-based censoring! More features are planned (Role management). BasicBot is currently hosted with AWS EC2. Interested in how BasicBot works?
