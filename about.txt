BasicBot is an open-source, Python-based Discord bot with basic functionality including youtube playback (with queue support) and Teamspeak-style VC join/leave messages, and keyword-based censoring! More features are planned (Role management). The source code can be found at https://github.com/UnderscoreBrad/BasicBot_PY and the bot hosted locally (for now).
